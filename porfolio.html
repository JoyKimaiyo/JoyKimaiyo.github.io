            <h1>Analyzing Superstore Data with Python and Power BI</h1>
            <p><strong>By Joyce Kimaiyo</strong> | 5 min read</p>
            
            <h2 id="business-question">Business Question</h2>
            <p>The analysis aims to address the following key business questions:

                Sales Performance:
                
                What are the overall sales trends, and how have they evolved? Are there any significant fluctuations that need to be addressed?
                Product Categories:
                
                Which product categories contributed the most to the company’s sales? Which categories are underperforming, if any?
                Geographic Insights:
                
                How does sales performance vary across the regions? Are there promising geographical regions or areas requiring improved marketing?
                Profitability:
                
                Which products are more profitable and which are not? With the available data, what factors affected the company’s profit? How is the company’s profitability during the period?.</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis</h2>
            <p>For data cleaning and exploratory analysis, I used pandas in Python. I find pandas easier to use when checking for null values and duplicates and exploring data for better understanding and effective analysis. 
                The data contains zero null values and 1 duplicate which .drop_duplicates() was used .</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>
            <img src="Screenshot (52).png" alt="Data Visualization Screenshot" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            <p>
                <li>What are the overall sales trends, and how have they evolved? Are there any significant fluctuations that need to be addressed?
                    To analyze how sales have evolved, we use a line chart, as it effectively visualizes trends over time. We click on the line chart visualization, drag the order date (year) to the x-axis, and sales to the y-axis. From the visualization, we observe that sales fluctuated in 2012, followed by a steady rise from 2013 to 2014.
                </li>
                <li>Which product categories contributed the most to the company’s sales? Which categories are underperforming, if any?
                    We select the pie chart visualization, drag the category field to the legend, and sales to the values. The pie chart reveals that office supplies contribute the least to sales, while technology contributes the most.
                </li>
                <li>How does sales performance vary across regions? Are there promising geographical regions or areas requiring improved marketing?
                    For this analysis, we use a bar chart. We drag the region field to the x-axis and sales to the y-axis. The visualization shows that the West performs the best, while the South performs the least. The East region is promising, ranking second in sales performance.
                </li>
                <li>Which products are more profitable, and which are not?
                    We use a multi-row card visualization to evaluate product performance. We drag the subcategory and profit fields into the card, add a title in the format tab, and sort the data in ascending order. The visualization indicates that accessories are the most profitable, while tables are not profitable at all.
                </li>
                <li>With the available data, what factors affected the company’s profit?
                    We conduct multiple analyses here:
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, the analysis examined the ship mode and find that standard shipping contributes the highest profit, while same-day shipping contributes less.</li>
                        <li>Next, we analyze the relationship between customer segments and profit was analyzed. Consumers contribute the highest profit.</li>
                        <li>Then, we look at state-wise profit and see that California generates the highest profit.</li>
                        <li>Finally, we check for seasonal variations and find that quarters 3 and 4 of every year consistently yield the highest profits.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </p>
            <img src="Screenshot (53).png" alt="Operational Efficiency Screenshot" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;">
            
            <h2 id="operational-efficiency">Operational Efficiency</h2>
            <p>The operational efficiency was assessed by calculating the average delivery time. Using a calculated column, we determine the difference between the order date and ship date. Next, we add a card visualization, drag the average delivery time to the fields, and find that the company’s average delivery time is almost 4 days.</p>
            
            <h2 id="customer-loyalty">Customer Loyalty</h2>
            <p>We evaluate customer loyalty by identifying repeated customers. Using a DAX calculation, we create a new measure with the formula. From this, we find there are 788 repeated customers.
                We can also analyze the average delivery time by ship mode and explore how delivery time impacts sales and profits.</p>
