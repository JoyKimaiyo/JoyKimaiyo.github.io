            <h1>Analyzing Superstore Data with Python and Power BI</h1>
            <p><strong>By Joyce Kimaiyo</strong> | 5 min read</p>
            
            <h2 id="business-question">Business Question</h2>
            <p>The analysis aims to address the following key business questions:

                Sales Performance:
                
                What are the overall sales trends, and how have they evolved? Are there any significant fluctuations that need to be addressed?
                Product Categories:
                
                Which product categories contributed the most to the companyâ€™s sales? Which categories are underperforming, if any?
                Geographic Insights:
                
                How does sales performance vary across the regions? Are there promising geographical regions or areas requiring improved marketing?
                Profitability:
                
                Which products are more profitable and which are not? With the available data, what factors affected the companyâ€™s profit? How is the companyâ€™s profitability during the period?.</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis</h2>
            <p>For data cleaning and exploratory analysis, I used pandas in Python. I find pandas easier to use when checking for null values and duplicates and exploring data for better understanding and effective analysis. 
                The data contains zero null values and 1 duplicate which .drop_duplicates() was used .</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>What are the overall sales trends, and how have they evolved? Are there any significant fluctuations that need to be addressed?  
                    <ul>
                        <li>A line chart is used to analyze sales trends over time. The order date (year) is placed on the x-axis, while sales are plotted on the y-axis.</li>
                        <li>The visualization reveals fluctuations in sales during 2012, followed by a steady increase from 2013 to 2014.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li>Which product categories contributed the most to the companyâ€™s sales? Which categories are underperforming, if any?  
                    <ul>
                        <li>A pie chart is utilized to determine category contributions. The category field is assigned to the legend, and sales are mapped to the values.</li>
                        <li>The visualization indicates that office supplies contribute the least to sales, whereas technology represents the highest contribution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li>How does sales performance vary across regions? Are there promising geographical regions or areas requiring improved marketing?  
                    <ul>
                        <li>A bar chart is used for regional sales performance analysis. The region field is assigned to the x-axis, and sales are plotted on the y-axis.</li>
                        <li>The visualization highlights that the West region performs the best, while the South has the lowest performance.</li>
                        <li>The East region ranks second in sales performance, showing potential for growth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li>Which products are more profitable, and which are not?  
                    <ul>
                        <li>A multi-row card visualization is used to evaluate product profitability.</li>
                        <li>The subcategory and profit fields are added to the card, a title is set in the format tab, and the data is sorted in ascending order.</li>
                        <li>The visualization reveals that accessories are the most profitable products, whereas tables generate no profit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
                <li>With the available data, what factors affected the companyâ€™s profit?  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ship mode analysis indicates that standard shipping yields the highest profit, while same-day shipping contributes the least.</li>
                        <li>Customer segment analysis shows that the consumer segment generates the highest profit.</li>
                        <li>State-wise profit analysis reveals that California produces the highest profit.</li>
                        <li>Seasonal variation analysis demonstrates that quarters three and four of each year consistently generate the highest profits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="operational-efficiency">Operational Efficiency</h2>
            <p>The operational efficiency was assessed by calculating the average delivery time. Using a calculated column, the difference between the order date and ship date was explored. Next, we add a card visualization, drag the average delivery time to the fields, and find that the companyâ€™s average delivery time is almost 4 days.</p>
            
            <h2 id="customer-loyalty">Customer Loyalty</h2>
            <p>The analysis evaluated the customer loyalty by identifying repeated customers, using a DAX calculation and a new measure with the formula. From this, there were 788 repeated customers.
                Also, the average delivery time by ship mode was analyzed and how delivery time impacts sales and profits.</p>
